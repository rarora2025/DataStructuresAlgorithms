### Step 1
'''
Write a Python function to find the minimum number in a list. The function should compare each number to every other number on the list, and have a runtime of $( O(n^2) )$. 

__IMPORTANT: Hopefully this approach goes against your instincts as it is very  inefficient.__
    
Use import checkmycode to make sure your function provides accurate results
'''

### Step 2
''' 
Then, using time and randrange from random, write a loop using that will help you see the runtimes as your input grows. This should show you that the runtime for this findmin function in $( O(n^2) )$.
    
There is no test code for the test loop but your output should look like this:

size: 1000 time: 0.025853
size: 2000 time: 0.110347
size: 3000 time: 0.247928
size: 4000 time: 0.446153
size: 5000 time: 0.695773
size: 6000 time: 0.992919
size: 7000 time: 1.357180
size: 8000 time: 1.790243
size: 9000 time: 2.264789
size: 10000 time: 2.827593
