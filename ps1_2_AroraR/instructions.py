### Step 1
'''
Devise an experiment with function test(alist, i) to verify that the __list__ index operator (i.e. alist[i]) is O(1).
    
Use import checkmycode to check your your function provides accurate results   
'''

### Step 2
''' 
Then, using time and randrange from random, write a loop using that will help you see the runtimes as your input grows. This should show you that the runtime for this findmin function in $( O(1) )$.
    
There is no test code for the test loop but your output should look like this:


size: 1000 returned: 7414 time: 0.000003
size: 2000 returned: 2832 time: 0.000002
size: 3000 returned: 2424 time: 0.000002
size: 4000 returned: 5684 time: 0.000002
size: 5000 returned: 8720 time: 0.000003
size: 6000 returned: 8939 time: 0.000002
size: 7000 returned: 4188 time: 0.000002
size: 8000 returned: 5929 time: 0.000002
size: 9000 returned: 4476 time: 0.000003
size: 10000 returned: 1461 time: 0.000003
