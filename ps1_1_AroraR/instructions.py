### Step 1
'''
Write a Python function, findMin(a) to find the minimum number in a list with a Big-O runtime of $( O(n) )$.
    
Use import checkmycode to check your function provides accurate results
'''

### Step 2 
'''
Then, using time and randrange from random, write a loop using that will help you see the runtimes as your input grows. This should show you that the runtime for this findmin function in $( O(n) )$.
    
There is no test code for the test loop but your output should look like this:

size: 1000 time: 0.000018
size: 2000 time: 0.000038
size: 3000 time: 0.000053
size: 4000 time: 0.000073
size: 5000 time: 0.000082
size: 6000 time: 0.000097
size: 7000 time: 0.000112
size: 8000 time: 0.000131
size: 9000 time: 0.000144
size: 10000 time: 0.000161
